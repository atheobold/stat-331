# Data

The dataset "mystery_animal.csv" contains the weights of a particular animal
before and after a year of eating only roasted duck.


# Linear Regression 

Fit a linear regression to determine if the Duck Diet is associated with the 
animal gaining weight, losing weight, or neither.


# Residuals  

Plot the residuals (observed value minus predicted value) of your linear model
versus `weight_before`. 


# Mystery Animal

What animal do you see?

## Overview

For your Final Project in Stat 331, you will use your new skills to create a
"deliverable."  This project should be a thoughtful, professional creation that
you will be proud to share even after this class is over.

Every group is expected to complete a written report outlining the "key" 
features of your model and it's predictions. Your group also has the opportunity 
to submit additional materials demonstrating key parts of your model through 
a Shiny app or Blogdown website. These additional materials will earn you
additional Challenge Points.  (Recall that any Challenge Points above the 100
required for that grade category are extra credit!)

Everyone in a group will receive the same grade, unless concerns are privately
expressed to me about member contributions in the final peer evaluation. Bonus
Challenge Points will be divided evenly across group members.

The **entire** final project is due on **Saturday, March 13th**. Since nothing
is due until the end of the course, it is your group's responsibility to ensure 
that you are staying on top of the work. You will be given class time to 
complete the project, both this Thursday and next week. I am also 
available to answer any questions you have on Discord! 


# The Written Report

Every group is required to complete the final written project, covering 
linear regression and model simulation. The written description of what you 
need to accomplish in each component of the project can be found in each 
week's "Final Project: Directions" document. This document will specify what 
you are required to do for the project and what must be included in your
written report. It is, however, up to you how you would like to structure your report (both content and style). 

Your analysis should read like a formal article, such as those that appear in
pop science journals like [this one](https://www.scientificamerican.com/). That
is, it should be *formatted* and *polished* - we shouldn't be able to see any
code unless it is absolutely necessary, plots and tables should have clear
labels, and the article should have a clear narrative flow.


#### Guidelines

You will turn in to me:

* Your .Rmd source file
    
* Your final report in html or pdf form.


# Extras 

Your group has the opportunity to complete additional components to the 
written report, to earn additional Challenge points. These "extra" components 
may take a great deal of time, so your **entire group** should make the decision 
as to whether you can complete the task. 

## Option A: Using $\LaTeX$

<!-- Stuff about writing out regression models using LaTex -->

<!-- Link to resources on writing LaTeX -->


## Option B: Animating a Plot [+10 Challenge Points]

A great extra for *any* plot is animation! The **gganimate** package makes 
it easy to animate **ggplot2** graphics. 

### Resources

The **gganimate** website (<https://gganimate.com/>) has a great "Getting 
Started" tutorial on how to make animated visualizations. 

### Guidelines

If your group chooses to embark on this adventure. I would like for you to 
include your animated visualization in your written report! 


## Option C: Shiny App [+20 Challenge Points]

One of the most exciting features of **R** is the package **shiny**.  

This package allows users to make fully interactive web applications directly
in **R**.

See some examples here: https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/

*Shiny* is awesome, and this is the extra that I would most suggest you
choose, unless you have a strong preference otherwise.

It will take you some extra work to learn how **shiny** works, and how to build
your app.  (Hence the bonus Challenge Points!)  However, I think you'll have fun
with your results.

The app should showcase in some way the data analysis you were asked to perform.
This analysis can be less formal, and less complex, than written report. 

### Resources

[This site](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/) has very thorough tutorials.

### Guidelines

If your group chooses to embark on this adventure. In addition to your written 
report, you will submit the following:

* A link to your completed app from shinyapps.io.  
  + At least one of your group members will need to make an account, so that you
  can upload your app.

* Submit to Canvas a .zip folder containing all relevant (data and code) files

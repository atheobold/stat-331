# Step 1: Installing `R` and RStudio

---

## Checking your R version

If you already have `R` downloaded, you need to confirm that you have the most
up to date version of `R`. **Do not ignore these instructions.** If you neglect
to update your version of R, you may find that updating a package will make it
so your code will not run. 

- Step 1: Open RStudio
- Step 2: At the top of the the Console it will say what version of R you are
using

![](images/r_version.png)

If the version **is not** 4.2.2 (like the image above), you need to update your
version of R! 

## Install R

Download and install R by going to [https://cloud.r-project.org/](https://cloud.r-project.org/).

If you are a **Windows** user: 

* Click on “Download R for Windows”

* Click on “base”

* Click on the Download link.


If you are a **Linux** user: 

Click on “Download R for Linux” and choose your distribution for more
information on installing `R` for your setup.


If you are **macOS** user: 

* Click on “Download R for (Mac) OS X”

* Under “Latest release:” click on R-X.X.X.pkg, where R-X.X.X is the version
number. For example, the latest version of R as of January 1, 2023 was R-4.2.2 
(Innocent & Trusting).

#### Troubleshooting for Macs

First, identify which version of OSx you are running. 
[How-to](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201260)

Next, find out which version of `R` your computer can run. 
[Link](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)

If this version is 3.5 or later, download the latest version that your computer
can handle.

If this version is 3.4 or earlier, you're going to run in to some trouble.  I
recommend updating your version of OSx, if you are willing.  If you can't, then
you can use [rstudio.cloud](rstudio.cloud) to run `R` and RStudio on a free
server.  However, I recommend strongly against this option; your files will not
be saved indefinitely, you will have limited hours to complete your work, your
computing power will be limited, and you will need an internet connection at all
times to do your work.

## Install RStudio

RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for `R`. What does that
mean? Well, if you think of `R` as a language, which it is, you can think of
RStudio as a program that helps you write and work in the language. RStudio
makes programming in `R` much easier and this course requires you to use it!

If you already have RStudio, you need to double check if you have the most 
recent version. You **cannot** create Quarto documents unless you have the 
most recent version of RStudio. 

- Step 1: Open RStudio
- Step 2: Click on "Help" in the upper menu
- Step 3: Click on "Check for Updates" 

If there are no updates to RStudio since you installed it, you are good to go! 
If you need to update RStudio, you will be sent to Posit (the parent company) to
download the most recent version of RStudio desktop. 

RStudio can be downloaded [here](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

# Installing Packages

### How to install R packages

`r emo::ji("play")` [Required Video: Installing R Packages (4 minutes)](http://youtu.be/tXZDoMlXfTE?hd=1)


### Install / Update the tidyverse

Now that you have the hang of working in RStudio, let's install / update the 
packages we will use in the course. 

In this course, we will make heavy use of the **tidyverse** suite of packages.

If you **have not** used the tidyverse before, type the following into your
**console** or use the drop down menu in the **Packages** tab:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

If you **have** used the tidyverse before, you only need to update packages.  
Type the following into your console:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
tidyverse_update()
```

Then follow the instructions that print out to update a few of your tidyverse
packages.

# Bringing it all together

`r emo::ji("check")` Check-in: Introduction to R & RStudio  

**Question 1:** What does it mean for R to be **"open-source"**?

a) Users are required to share all the code they write.
b) Private companies must pay the *R Core Group* to use R.
c) Developers cannot charge for the use of their R software.
d) Anyone can change the base functionality of R.


**Question 2:** How often do you need to install a package on your computer?

b) Only once. Afterwards, R can find the package on your hard drive when it needs to.
c) Never, as long as you are connected to the internet.
d) Every time you restart your computer.

**Question 3:** What is the tidyverse? 

a) A word processing program for R.
b? An alternate universe where everyone is an R programmer.
c) A collection of packages that work well together and provide tools for common
data science tasks.
d) A code style that reads like poetry.

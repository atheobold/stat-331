# Step 1: Installing `R` and RStudio

---

## Install R

*If you already have `R` downloaded, please follow these steps anyways, to make sure
you have the most recent version of `R`.*

Download and install R by going to [https://cloud.r-project.org/](https://cloud.r-project.org/).

If you are a **Windows** user: 

* Click on “Download R for Windows”

* Click on “base”

* Click on the Download link.


If you are a **Linux** user: 

Click on “Download R for Linux” and choose your distribution for more information on installing `R` for your setup.


If you are **macOS** user: 

* Click on “Download R for (Mac) OS X”

* Under “Latest release:” click on R-X.X.X.pkg, where R-X.X.X is the version number. For example, the latest version of R as of February 15, 2021 was R-4.0.4.

#### Troubleshooting for Macs

First, identify which version of OSx you are running.  [How-to](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201260)

Next, find out which version of `R` your computer can run.  [Link](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)

If this version is 3.5 or later, download the latest version that your computer
can handle.

If this version is 3.4 or earlier, you're going to run in to some trouble.  I
recommend updating your version of OSx, if you are willing.  If you can't, then
you can use [rstudio.cloud](rstudio.cloud) to run `R` and RStudio on a free
server.  However, I recommend strongly against this option; your files will not
be saved indefinitely, you will have limited hours to complete your work, your
computing power will be limited, and you will need an internet connection at all
times to do your work.

## Install RStudio

RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for `R`. What does that
mean? Well, if you think of `R` as a language, which it is, you can think of
RStudio as a program that helps you write and work in the language. RStudio
makes programming in `R` much easier and I suggest that you use it!

RStudio can be downloaded [here](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

If you already have RStudio:

You **do not** need an update if your RStudio logo looks like this: <img src='../../Images/other/rs_icon_new.png' height='25' width='50'>

You **do** need an update if your RStudio logo looks like this: <img src='../../Images/other/rs_icon_old.png' height='25' width='25'>

# Installing Packages

### How to install R packages

[Video Tutorial on Installing R Packages](http://youtu.be/tXZDoMlXfTE?hd=1)


### Install / Update the tidyverse

Now that you have the hang of working in RStudio, let's install / update the 
packages we will use in the course. 

In this course, we will make heavy use of the **tidyverse** suite of packages.

If you **have not** used the tidyverse before, type the following into your **console**:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

If you **have** used the tidyverse before, you only need to update packages.  
Type the following into your console:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
tidyverse_update()
```

Then follow the instructions that print out to update a few of your tidyverse packages.

The theme of this lesson is good management of your files and data.

You will learn how to:

-   Identify **folders** and **paths**.

-   Create and use **R Projects**.

-   **Load data** into R from files.

-   Deal with package challenges.

-   Create R Markdown or Quarto documents with good **reproducible
    principles**.

`r emo::ji("check")` Check-in: RStudio Projects

Take a screenshot of your class directory, showing the **R Project** and
the folder organization, including a **Week 1** or **Preview Activity**
folder.

::: {.callout-caution}
Your RStudio project **cannot** be in a folder stored on OneDrive or iCloud! 
Storing your project in this location will cause your code to periodically not
run and I cannot help you fix it. 

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai-HV_7TmL4) is a video showing how you
need to set-up your STAT 331 folder and RStudio Project.

## Reproducible Deliverables

We will be using Quarto documents in this course. To compile a Quarto document,
you first need to download the Quarto software. You can do that [here]().

- I absolutely love [this blog](https://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/quarto-tip-a-day/)
by Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel for all of the additions you can make to your Quarto 
documents. 

- Poke around the [gallery of cool Quarto documents](https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/). 
Here are some of my favorites:  
  * [Interactive document published to the web](https://quarto-dev.github.io/quarto-gallery/articles/html/html.html)

# What is Markdown?

**Markdown** (without the "R") is a *markup language*.  This means special
symbols and formatting to pretty documents.

--

Markdown files have the **.md** extension.

# What is R Markdown?

**R Markdown** (with the "R") uses regular Markdown, plus it can run and display
**R** code.  (Other languages, too!)

--

R Markdown files have the **.Rmd** extension.

# Markdown 

**Markdown** (without the "R") is a *markup language*.  This means special
symbols and formatting to pretty documents.

\*text\* -- makes italics 

\*\*text\*\* -- makes bold text

\# -- makes headers 

\!\[ \]( ) -- includes images or HTML links

< > -- embeds URLs

# R Code 

- Begins with three ` ``` ` characters 
- Then a curly brace `{`
- Then a letter `r` 
- Then an (optional) name 
- Then specifications for the code chunk 
- Closes with three ` ``` ` characters

# Knitting

To convert your R Markdown file to a beautiful document, click **Knit**.

# Knitting a Document

---

# Knitting

When you click **knit**, here is what happens:

--

- Your file is saved.

--

- The R code written in your *.Rmd* file gets run.

    + Any code you ran already doesn't "count"; we start from scratch.
    + The code is run *in order*.

--

- A new file is created.

    + If your R Markdown file is called "Lab1.Rmd", then a file called "Lab1.html" will be created.
    + This will save in the same folder as "Lab1.Rmd".

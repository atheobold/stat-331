# Synchronous Meetings

This is a *synchronous* **in-person** course, scheduled to meet on Tuesdays and
Thursdays for 2 hours at a time. 

We **will** be meeting every Tuesday and Thursday this quarter, and attendance
is expected. 

---

# Using the Class Discord

We'll be using Discord to interact with our peers and group members. 

Discord is a platform for text chatting, voice chatting, and screen sharing.

In particular, course **office hours** are held via Discord. I will be available
for public questions, or one-on-one and small group chats by text, voice, or
video.

The office hours for this class are:

#### Tuesdays & Thursdays from 2:30 - 3:30pm **in-person**
#### Fridays from 9:00 - 10:00am **on Discord**

I will often be willing to hop on Discord and help out at other times, and I
will answer text chat questions regularly throughout every day!

## Join the server

Join the [Stat 331 Server (https://discord.gg/tZ5aFhhN)](https://discord.gg/yTSy4K59)
to start experimenting with the interface.

When you join the server, you will be given some suggestions to get started.  

![](../../Images/screencast_gifs/welcome_discord.png)


I recommend you click through these - and in particular, it is probably a good
idea to download the desktop version of Discord, and perhaps to install it on
your phone if you wish.

## Set up your account

### Verify your email

To use this Discord server, you **must** have a verified email.  

Nobody (including your professors) will be able to see this email, and it does 
not have to be your Cal Poly email.  This is simply to keep the server from
being overrun by temporary accounts.


### Create your identity

The first thing you should do is decide what name and picture you would like to
use.


![](../../Images/screencast_gifs/pic.gif)

I would like to **strongly** encourage you to use your **real name and picture**, 
so that everyone can get to know you.  However, if you prefer to remain
anonymous, you are free to do so.

![](../../Images/screencast_gifs/pic_name.gif)


(Please do not be like Regina and use the name of another student, however!  
This kind of impersonation will result in a permanent ban from the server.)


### Decide about privacy and notifications

The default settings on the channel are probably just fine for you.  
Feel free to make any changes that work for you, though.

You can change your message notifications:

![](../../Images/screencast_gifs/notifications.gif)


You can edit your privacy settings, although most things are already private:

![](../../Images/screencast_gifs/privacy.gif)

### Connect other apps

You can connect other apps to Discord, either for productivity or just for fun.

![](../../Images/screencast_gifs/connect_spotify.gif)


## Using the Channels

The server is made up of many channels.  Some are text chatrooms, while some are
"Voice Channels" that connect you via audio to everyone else in the channel.


### Text Channels

Use the `#general` channel for anything and everything:

![](../../Images/screencast_gifs/saying_hi.gif)

If your question is about course logistics, rather than the material itself,
consider using the `#class-logistics` channel:

![](../../Images/screencast_gifs/logistics.gif)


You can use the specific weekly channels to ask questions about the material...

![](../../Images/screencast_gifs/github.gif)

... or the specific lab assignment.


![](../../Images/screencast_gifs/code_in_chat.gif)

Notice that you can use tick marks (` ``` `), like in R Markdown, to make your
code appear in a formatted code box.


### Voice Channels

To join a voice channel, simply click it!  Make sure you are careful about when
you are muted or unmuted.

![](../../Images/screencast_gifs/voice_channel.gif)

The extra "Side Chat" channels are limited to 4 or 8 people, if you would like
to start an impromptu study conversation without being heard by me and / or the
rest of the class.  (I'll only drop in if you invite us!)

Voice channels can also be used for people to "Go Live", and share their screen
with everyone else.

![](../../Images/screencast_gifs/going_live.gif)

While this will usually be something professors use to demonstrate code, you can
go live, too!  But you may need to download the desktop version of Discord to do
so.

### Private messages

It is also easy to send private messages, to your professor or to each other. 
These private messages can also easily be used to launch a private video chat
and / or screen sharing.

![](../../Images/screencast_gifs/private_message.gif)

## Creating your own server

Last but not least - for the teams you are a part of, you may want to use
Discord to communicate with each other about the weekly assignments. You can do
this by creating your own server! You can easily hop between servers during work
parties, to ask each other questions or just to take a break and chat about
life.


![](../../Images/screencast_gifs/new_server.gif)


## See you at the Party!

## `r emo::ji("check")` Check-in 1: Discord Server

Introduce yourself in the "Introductions" channel of the Discord Server.

# Course Structure

## What your typical week will look like

### Coursework

Each week, you will be expected to work through a sequence of readings, videos,
and preview activities. (Much like this one!)

These are meant to replace the in-class lecture experience; thus, you should
plan to devote about 1 - 3 hours a week to this coursework. 

### Preview Activities

*Due Tuesdays at 8am*

Before class, you’ll complete Preview Activities which will guide you through
your first contact with new concepts.

These will involve readings, videos, along with exercises to build your basic
skill fluency. For example, you might be asked to read a chapter from the course
textbook, watch a few videos discussing some concepts from the chapter, and then
asked to complete some preliminary exercises intended to get you started
thinking about how to apply the concepts from the chapter in the context of real
data. 

You’ll submit these exercises online, so that class time can be customized based
on your understanding.

### Practice Activities

*Due Wednesdays at midnight*

During class, you’ll be working with your classmates to complete Practice
Activities, which take your Preview Activities a step further. You will
collaborate with your team to solve a puzzle, requiring that you  accomplish a
series of tasks, each of which applies the statistical computing concepts from
that week. The purpose of in-class time is for you to be doing statistical
computing, with me there to guide you if / when you get lost. 

The course meetings on Tuesdays will have at least 1-hour dedicated to working
on these practice activities, where you will work in your team. This allows for
you to have the ability to ask me questions during the early stages of the
activity. 

### Lab Assignments

*Due Sundays at midnight*

After class, you can reinforce the material through Lab Assignments, which are
an opportunity to demonstrate mastery of the skills that you’ve learned. If you
got something wrong, don’t worry! You’ll have a chance to try again.

Labs will be submitted on Canvas. All revisions to Lab Assignments will be 
submitted to the **same** Canvas portal as the original assignment. 


### Challenges

*Due Sundays at midnight*

Each Lab Assignment will have a Challenge Problem, which asks you to extend
the skills you’ve learned in class in some way. Frequently, you have the choice 
of what you would like to learn. The only requirement is that you extend your thinking in some (measureable) way. 

Although you may discuss ideas with your classmates and seek help from the usual
sources, all code and text **absolutely must** be your own.  

Challenges will be submitted on Canvas. All revisions to Challenges will be 
submitted to the **same** Canvas portal as the original assignment. 

## `r emo::ji("check")` Check-in 2: Syllabus Quiz

**Question 1:** Where are my office hours held? 

**Question 2:** What materials and technology are required for this course? 

**Question 3:** In this course, Preview Activities are due by 8am every ____. 
Practice Activities are due by midnight every ____. Lab Assignments and
Challenges are due by midnight every ____.  

**Question 4:** If you receive a "Growing" on a Lab Assignment problem, what 
should you do?

**Question 5:** For revisions on Lab Assignments and Challenges to be considered
that week they need to be turned in by:

**Question 6:** You have finished the week's Practice Assignment, and you want
to know if you did it right.  You ask your friend, and she says, "Oh, I got *Luke
Skywalker* as my answer."  This is a violation of the Academic Honesty policy. 

**Question 7:** You and a friend have been working on Lab 1 together.  You finish
up and want to go to bed, but she is still a little confused.  You email her your
file, and say, "Don't copy this, just look how I did it so you can figure it out."
Have you violated Academic Honesty policies?

**Question 8:** You have been working on Challenge 1 for what feels like forever
and it seems like you are making little to no progress. You type the prompt into
Google and "Wham!" the first result is a Stack Overflow page with a solution. 
You copy-and-paste the solution from the Stack Overflow page into your Challenge
submission and do not reference that you used an outside source. You have
violated the Academic Honesty policy. 

**Question 9:** Name one of the course learning targets that makes you excited.

**Question 10:** Name one of the course learning targets that makes you nervous.

**Question 11:** What personal goals did you write for yourself on Day 1? Why
are you taking this class? What do you hope to learn?

# What to do when you have questions

Stuck on something, or have a logistical question about the course?  
Follow these easy steps to success!

### Make sure your question isn't already answered somewhere.

#### Double-check the syllabus.

![](https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/cte/events_calendar/spring_2016/images/developing_course_syllabus.png)

#### Double-check the instructions for the assignment.

Remember that most details will appear in the Coursework pages or in the Lab
Assignment instructions - **not** in the submission links on Canvas.

#### Double-check the Announcements

On the "Account" section of Canvas, under "Notifications", make sure your
preferences are updated for Announcements.  We recommend opting to receive an
email any time an announcement is posted.


![](../../Images/screencast_gifs/notifications.png)

### Ask your question on Discord

If you post your question to a text channel, you will probably get a fast
response from a classmate.  If not, you will get a response from me within 24 
hours.

# Tips for succeeding in this class:

## Take the Coursework pages as seriously as you take in-person lecture.

Flipped classrooms puts you in the driver seat of mastering the course material.
It can be tempting to cut corners to save yourself time, but this will likely
result in you having a less complete understanding of the material. 

I encourage you to commit to giving the Coursework segments the same 
level of attention that you would ordinarily give to in-class lecture. Put the
same effort into the Preview Activities that you would if you were sitting in a
classroom. In return for your efforts, I promise to choose required videos and
readings carefully, so that I do not waste your time.

## Google is your friend.

The R community has an enormous aresenal of online learning resources.  I've
linked a few on the "Extra Resources" module in Canvas, but you can always find
more!

![](https://media3.giphy.com/media/3oKIPmM4hkQIf4p5T2/source.gif)

Learn to:

- Google for tutorials and examples
- Use [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- Ask questions on Twitter
- Make good use of the vast and welcoming R network on the internet

##  Use your team for your benefit!

This course makes use of team-based learning. In the first week you will be
placed into a team that will last for the first five weeks of the course. After
the midterm reflection, you will be given the option to join a new group or
stick with the group you've been working with thus far. 

Outside of your group, I encourage you to establish study buddies and / or study
groups early in the quarter, even if you don't know anyone yet.  

The class Discord server is a great way to get started. I also hope you will
be proactive about setting up your own video chat sessions, phone calls, Google
Docs, group chats, etc.  (How many different platforms can you talk about Stat
331 on?  Facebook? Snapchat?  Instagram?  TikTok?  Bumble???)

I hope that we will all be purposeful and creative about finding ways to work as
a team.

## Confidence Intervals


```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
req_vid("Overview of Confidence Intervals", type = "Required", url = "https://www.youtube.com/embed/SoOWQTBEV20")
```


```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
req_tutorial("Simulate some confidence intervals", type = "Required", url = "https://rpsychologist.com/d3/ci/")
```


```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
req_vid("Calculating Confidence Intervals", type = "Optional", url = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJe3jiZNwUU")

Educators in California are concerned that high school students do not get enough sleep.  They collect data about 300 students, and calculate a 99\% confidence interval for the average hours of sleep a night to be $(7.0, 7.5)$.


Which of the following is a correct interpretation of the confidence interval?

*  99% of all high school students get between 7 and 7.5 hours of sleep per night.
*  99% of the 300 students surveyed got between 7 and 7.5 hours of sleep per night.
*  We are 99% confident that the 300 students surveyed got between 7 and 7.5 hours of sleep on average per night.
*  We are 99% confident that California students get between 7 and 7.5 hours of sleep on average per night.
*  There is a 99% probability of a student getting between 7 and 7.5 hours of sleep.
*  There is a 99% probability that the true mean hours of sleep of California students is between 7 and 7.5 hours of sleep.

## Bootstrapping

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
req_vid("Bootstrapping", type = "Required", url = "https://www.youtube.com/embed/fV3vZ_uHDPI")
```

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
req_read("Modern Dive Chapter 8:  Bootstrapping and Confidence Intervals", type = "Required", url = "https://moderndive.com/8-confidence-intervals.html")
```

You don't need to carefully read every word in this chapter, but please look over it.
In particular, you'll find some shortcuts from the `infer` package that make the
bootstrapping process even easier and cleaner!

```{r, results = "asis", echo = FALSE}
req_read("Confidence Intervals and Bootstrapping", type = "Recommended", url = "https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/frequentist-inference/index.html")

**Fun Fact:** 

The term "bootstrap" comes from the phrase "pull yourself up by your bootstraps!"
meaning, essentially, that you should take responsibility for your own life improvement.

This is kind of a joke - of course, you can't fly through the air by grabbing
your shoelaces and pulling up!

Similarly, the bootstrap procedure in statistics feels a bit like cheating; we're magically 
making more samples from our original.

It's one of my favorite terms in all of statistics!

Use the `mtcars` dataset to study horsepower of cars (`hp`).

Make a **95% Confidence Interval** for:

* The mean horsepower

* The median horsepower

* The variance of horsepower

data(diamonds)
```

## Estimating the mean

The `diamonds` dataset contains information about 53940 diamonds.

Suppose we want to estimate the mean `table` (flat top size) of a Premium diamond.

```{r}

diamonds <- diamonds %>%
  filter(cut == "Premium")

nrow(diamonds)

diamonds %>%
  summarize(mean(table))

```


---
## Estimating the mean

Of course, the 13,791 Premium diamonds in this dataset are **not** all the
diamonds in the world.  

--

So the **true mean** table of a Premium diamond is probably not *exactly* 58.741.

---
## Estimating the mean

What would be a **reasonable range** of guesses for the **true mean**?

```{r}

diamonds %>%
  summarize(mean(table), sd(table))
```

---
class: center, middle, inverse

## Checkpoint: *Confidence Intervals*

---
## Confidence

```{r}
my_test <- diamonds %>%
  t_test(response = table)

my_test %>% select(lower_ci, upper_ci)
```

Based on **this sample**, we are **95% confident** that the **true mean** is between `r round(my_test$lower_ci, 3)` and `r round(my_test$upper_ci, 3)`.

---
## Confidence

... But what does this mean?

# What assumptions did we rely on?

---
## The t distribution

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(, aes(x = -5:5)) + stat_function(fun = dt, args = list(df = 99), color = "darkred", size = 2) + xlab("t statistic")
```


---
## Our data

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = table)) +  
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 1, fill = "pink", color = "black")+
  stat_function(fun = dnorm,
                args = list(mean = mean(diamonds$table), sd = sd(diamonds$table)),
                color = "cornflowerblue", lwd = 1.5) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(50, 65)) +
  theme_bw()
```
---
## Confidence Intervals

```{r}
diamonds %>%
  pull(table) %>%
  quantile(c(.025, .975))
```
--

```{r}
my_test %>% select(lower_ci, upper_ci)

```

---
## The data

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = table)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 1, fill = "pink", color = "black")+
  theme_bw() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(55, 62), lwd = 1.5, color = "cornflowerblue") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(50, 65))
```

---
## A subsample of the data

```{r}
set.seed(1094)

diamonds_subsample <- diamonds %>% sample_n(100)

diamonds_subsample %>%
  pull(table) %>%
  quantile(c(0.025, 0.975))
```

---
## A subsample of the data


```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(diamonds_subsample, aes(x = table)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 1, fill = "pink", color = "black")+
  theme_bw() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(55, 62), lwd = 1.5, color = "cornflowerblue") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(50, 65))
```



---
## Confidence interval **of the mean**

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = table)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 1, fill = "pink", color = "black")+
  theme_bw() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(58.721, 58.770), lwd = 1.5, color = "cornflowerblue") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(50, 65))
```

---
## Confidence interval **of the mean**

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = table)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 1, fill = "pink", color = "black")+
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(58.721, 58.770), lwd = 1.5, color = "cornflowerblue")+
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(57, 60))+
    theme_bw() 
```

# The Central Limit Theorem!

--

## The *sample mean* is approximately Normal (t)

## As long as it's a mean of many (say > 15) samples.


---
## The problem of skew

Consider now the question of estimating the mean **price** of Premium diamonds.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price)) +  
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), bins = 100, fill = "pink", color = "black")+
  stat_function(fun = dnorm,
                args = list(mean = mean(diamonds$price), sd = sd(diamonds$price)),
                color = "cornflowerblue", lwd = 1.5) +
  theme_bw()
```

---
## Confidence Interval from t-distribution

```{r}
my_test_2 <- diamonds %>%
  t_test(response = price)

my_test_2 %>% select(lower_ci, upper_ci)
```

---
class: center, middle
# Ask yourself...

Do you trust the t-confidence interval?

--

**YES!**  Central Limit Theorem!

--

* Is the mean the best measure of center?

--

**NO!**  The skew pulls the mean to the right.

--

* How would you make a confidence interval for the median?

--

Pull yourself up by your **bootstraps**!

---

---
## Idea:


* If we had **many** samples, we could compute the median of each sample and see what happens.

--

* But: we only have one sample. :(

--

* A large enough representative sample from a population is a good approximation for the population.

--

* Thus:  **Re-sample** from our sample!

---
## Resampling

*(Why `replace = TRUE`?)*


```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  sample_n(13791, replace = TRUE) %>%
  select(price) %>%
  head()
```

---
## Resampling

Observations might be sampled more than once!


```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  sample_n(13791, replace = TRUE) %>%
  count(price, sort = TRUE) %>%
  slice(1:6)
```
---
## Resampling

Doing this multiple times gives different resamplings.

--

We can calculate the median price of each resampling:

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  sample_n(13791, replace = TRUE) %>%
  summarize(median(price))
```

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  sample_n(13791, replace = TRUE) %>%
  summarize(median(price))
```
---
class: center, middle, invert
# Now, we just have to copy-paste that a bunch of times, right???

--

# Nope!  **modelr** to the rescue

---
## Bootstrapping

The `bootstrap` function takes many resamplings.

--

**CAREFUL!** You want the `bootstrap` function from the `modelr` package,
not from any other package you might have loaded, like `broom`!

--

```{r, cache = TRUE}
my_boots <- diamonds %>% modelr::bootstrap(100)
my_boots %>% head()
```

---
class: center, middle, inverse

# WARNING!

## Bootstrapping can be computationally intense.  

## Start with a smaller number of resamplings (say, 10) before you try big numbers.

---
## Bootstrapping

What is that object in `my_boots$strap`?

```{r}
str(my_boots$strap[1])
```
---
## Bootstrapping

The `resample` object is a list containing:

* `$data$`, a *pointer* to the original dataset.

* `$idx` a vector of resampled indices

--

Why?

--

Saving many copies of the **dataset** is hard.

Saving many **vectors of indices** is easy!

---
## Bootstrapping

A `resample` object can automatically convert to the resampled data frame:

```{r}
data.frame(my_boots$strap[1])
```

---
## Bootstrapping

We are really just interested in the **Median price**.

So, let's calculate it for **each resampling**:

--

```{r}
boot_medians <- map_dbl(my_boots$strap, ~median(data.frame(.x)$price))
                        
boot_medians
```
---
## Bootstrapping

Better yet, let's add these to our data frame:

```{r}
my_boots <- my_boots %>%
  mutate(
    boot_medians = map_dbl(strap, ~median(data.frame(.x)$price))
  )

my_boots %>% head()
```


---
## Any one resampling by itself is not very interesting...

```{r, echo = FALSE}
my_boots$strap[1] %>%
  data.frame() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = price)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), bins = 100, fill = "pink", color = "black") +
   geom_vline(xintercept = median(diamonds$price), color = "cornflowerblue", lwd = 1.2) +
  theme_bw()
```

---
## ... but the **medians** of **all** the resamplings are!

```{r, echo = FALSE}
my_boots %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = boot_medians)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), bins = 10, fill = "cornflowerblue", color = "black") +
  theme_bw()
```
---
## Put them together:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
diamonds %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = price, y = ..density..), binwidth = 500,
                 fill = "pink", color = "black", alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_histogram(data = my_boots, aes(x = boot_medians, y = ..density../10), binwidth = 100,
                 fill = "cornflowerblue", color = "black", alpha = 0.5) 
```

---
## Bootstrapped Confidence Intervals

What's a **reasonable range** of guesses for the **true median** price?

--

Well, where did most of our **bootstrapped medians** fall?

--

```{r}
my_boots %>%
  pull(boot_medians) %>%
  quantile(c(0.025, 0.975))
```


---
## Bootstrapped medians

```{r, echo = FALSE}
my_boots %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = boot_medians, y = ..density..)) + 
  geom_histogram(fill = "cornflowerblue", color = "black") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(3071, 3353), color = "orange", lwd = 1.2)
  theme_bw()
```

Use the `mtcars` dataset to study horsepower of cars (`hp`).

Make a **95% Confidence Interval** for:

* The mean horsepower

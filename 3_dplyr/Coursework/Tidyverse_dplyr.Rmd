```{r, include = FALSE}

```

In this lesson, you'll learn 

- More about packages in R

- More about the differences between `list`s, `data.frame`s, and `tibble`s

- How to wrangle data using the **dplyr** package in 
the **tidyverse**

</br>

When you are finished with the readings and videos, you should be able to...

* Describe to someone what a function conflict is 

* Describe to someone the similarities and differences between a `list`, a 
`data.frame`, and a `tibble`

* Identify the **structure** of an object 

* Identify the **data type(s)** of an object  

* Describe to someone what the *tidyverse* is

* Use the five main dplyr verbs:

  * `filter()`
  
  * `arrange()`
  
  * `select()`
  
  * `mutate()`
  
  * `summarize()`

* Use `group_by()` to perform groupwise operations

* Use the pipe operator (`%>%`) to chain together data wrangling operations

`r emo::ji("check")` Chech-in: Data Structures 

This lecture did **not** explicitly discuss the important structure of
**`data.frames`**.

That's because, in essence, a `data.frame` is simply a special `list` - with
a few extra restrictions on the `list` format.  

Think about the datasets you have already worked with. Which of the following
restrictions on a `list` do you think are needed for the `list` to be a
`data.frame`?

a) The elements of the list must all be vectors of the same length.
b) The elements of the list must all be the same data type.
c) The elements of the list must all have no missing values.
d) The elements of the list must all have names.

`r emo::ji("check")` Check-in: Data Wrangling


**Question 1:**  Suppose we would like to study how the ratio of penguin body
mass to flipper size differs across the species.  Rearrange the following steps
into an order that accomplishes this goal (assuming the steps are connected with
a `%>%`).

```{r, include = FALSE}
penguins %>%
  mutate(
    mass_flipper_ratio = body_mass_g/flipper_length_mm
  ) %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(
    avg_mass_flipper_ratio = median(mass_flipper_ratio)
  ) %>%
  arrange(avg_mass_flipper_ratio)

#cebda
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# a
arrange(avg_mass_flipper_ratioo)


# b
group_by(species)

# c
penguins 
  

# d
summarize(
  avg_mass_flipper_ratioo = median(mass_flipper_ratio)
)
  
# e
mutate(
  mass_flipper_ratio = body_mass_g/flipper_length_mm
)
  
```

**Question 2:** 

Consider the base R code below.


```{r, eval = FALSE}
mean(penguins[penguins$species == "Adelie", "body_mass_g"])
```

<!-- Mean of Adelie specied body mass!  -->

For each of the following `dplyr` pipelines, indicate if it

(i) Returns the exact same thing as the (above) base R code;
(ii) Returns the correct information, but the wrong object type;
(iii) Returns incorrect information; or
(iv) Returns an error

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# a
penguins %>%
  filter("body_mass_g") %>%
  pull("Adelie") %>%
  mean()


# b
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  select(body_mass_g) %>%
  summarize(mean(body_mass_g))


# c
penguins %>%
  pull(body_mass_g) %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  mean()

# d
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  select(body_mass_g) %>%
  mean()

# e
penguins %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  pull(body_mass_g) %>%
  mean()

# f
penguins %>%
  select(species == "Adelie") %>%
  filter(body_mass_g) %>%
  summarize(mean(body_mass_g))
```

<!-- A = incorrect filter statement -> Error -->

<!-- B = correct information but a tibble not a vector -->

<!-- C = cannot filter when species is gone -> Error  -->

<!-- D = doesn't return a correct value, no input to mean()  -->

<!-- E = same as base R, vector output -->

<!-- F = flipped filter and select -> Error  -->

title: "Week 3 Reflection Prompt"

---


Your first reflection will be submitted at the end of this week (October 9). 
This will be your first experience writing a narrative about your learning and
your accomplishments, so I do not expect for it to be perfect! But, I do expect
you to take this process seriously and put honest effort into writing your reflection. 

### Reflection Outline

Here is a skeleton of what I want you to address in your reflection. 

- An assessment of the grade you believe you have earned for the course. 
Consider this a proposal. Your reflection provides “evidence” in favor of your
proposed grade. 


### Length Requirements

I would appreciate it if your reflection is no more than 2-pages double spaced.
If your reflection is less than half a page, you haven't written enough. You can
choose to write your reflection in whatever software you wish, but I will only
accept HTML, PDF, and Word documents. *Note:* You can make all these documents
in Quarto! 

### What you can expect from me

Similar to your lab assignments, I will provide feedback on your reflection, celebrating  your accomplishments and pointing out any places we don’t see eye-to-eye. It is possible your grade and my grade do not agree, but that is where the conversation starts!

.larger[Assumptions when Removing]

--

- Without inspection:

  * Observations are "missing **completely** at random" 

<!-- When observations of a variable are missing completely at random, the missing observations are a random subset of all observations; the missing and observed values will have similar distributions. -->

--

- With information about the "missingness" 

  * Observations are "missing at random"

<!-- Missing at random means there might be systematic differences between the missing and observed values, but these can be entirely explained by other observed variables. -->

.large[**If** fish length measurements are missing at random, conditional on month, year, and river section,]

.large[**then** the distributions of lengths will be similar for fish of the same 
month, year, and river section.]

class: middle

.larger[Why Scale?]

- (More) difficult to compare 

- (More) difficult to model

class: middle

.larger[Why not Scale?]

- Difficult to interpret

# Challenge 1 

> Using pipes, subset the `surveys` data to include animals collected before
> 1995 and retain only the columns `year`, `sex`, and `weight`.
 
 
```{r, answer=TRUE, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
surveys %>%
     filter(year < 1995) %>%
     select(year, sex, weight)
```

# Challenge 2

> Create a new data frame from the `surveys` data that meets the following
> criteria: contains only the `species_id` column and a new column called
> `hindfoot_cm` containing the `hindfoot_length` values converted to centimeters.
> In this `hindfoot_cm` column, there are no `NA`s and all values are less
> than 3.

> **Hint**: think about how the commands should be ordered to produce this data 
> frame!
 
```{r, answer=TRUE, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
surveys_hindfoot_cm <- surveys %>%
     filter(!is.na(hindfoot_length)) %>%
     mutate(hindfoot_cm = hindfoot_length / 10) %>%
     filter(hindfoot_cm < 3) %>%
     select(species_id, hindfoot_cm)
```

# Challenge 3

## Part 1
> How many animals were caught in each `plot_type` surveyed?

```{r, answer=TRUE, purl=FALSE}
surveys %>%
        count(plot_type) 
```


## Part 2 
> Use `group_by()` and `summarize()` to find the mean, min, and max hindfoot
> length for each species (using `species_id`). Also add the number of
> observations (hint: see `?n`).

```{r, answer=TRUE, purl=FALSE}
surveys %>%
    filter(!is.na(hindfoot_length)) %>%
    group_by(species_id) %>%
    summarize(
            mean_hindfoot_length = mean(hindfoot_length),
            min_hindfoot_length = min(hindfoot_length),
            max_hindfoot_length = max(hindfoot_length),
            n = n()
            )
```

## Part 3 
> What was the heaviest animal measured in each year? Return the columns `year`,
> `genus`, `species_id`, and `weight`.

```{r, answer=TRUE, purl=FALSE}
surveys %>%
    filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
    group_by(year) %>%
    filter(weight == max(weight)) %>%
    select(year, genus, species, weight) %>%
    arrange(year)
```


# Challenge 4  
## Part 1  

> 1. Pivot the `combined` data frame to a wide format, with `year` as columns, 
>   `plot_id` as rows, and the number of genera per plot as the values. You will
>   need to summarize before reshaping, and use the function `n_distinct()` to 
>   get the number of unique genera within a particular chunk of data. It's a 
>   powerful function! See `?n_distinct` for more.

```{r, answer=TRUE, purl=FALSE}
surveys_wide_genera <- combined %>%
  group_by(plot_id, year) %>%
  summarize(n_genera = n_distinct(genus)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = n_genera)
 
View(surveys_wide_genera)
```

## Part 2 

> 2. Now take that data frame and use `pivot_longer()` to pivot it to the long 
>    format it was in before, so that each row is a unique `plot_id` by `year` 
>    combination.


```{r, answer=TRUE, purl=FALSE}
surveys_wide_genera %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -plot_id, names_to = "year", values_to = "n_genera")

## first argment is what columns you want to gather (- means everything but this column)
## second argment is what the name of the new column (with the pivoted columns) will be
## third argument is what the name of the new value column (with the values of the cells) will be
```


## Part 3 

> 3. The `complete` data set has two measurement columns: `hindfoot_length` and
>    `weight`.  This makes it difficult to do things like look at the 
>    relationship between mean values of each measurement per year in different
>    plot types. Let's walk through a common solution for this type of problem.
>    First, use `pivot_longer()` to create a dataset where we have a names 
>    column called `measurement` and a values column that takes on the value of 
>    either `hindfoot_length` or `weight`. 
>
>    *Hint*: You'll need to specify which columns to pivot into longer format!

```{r, answer=TRUE, purl=FALSE}
combined_long <- combined %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = hindfoot_length:weight, 
               names_to = "measurement", 
               values_to = "value")

## If the columns were not sequential we woud instead have used: 
## cols = c(hindfoot_length, weight)

## Remember: when you pivot columns to a long format, you have to create two 
## new columns!
## First: where the names of the pivoted columns go (names_to)
## Second: where the values inside the pivoted columns go (values_to)  
```


## Part 4 

> 4. With this new data set, calculate the average of each `measurement` in each
>    `year` for each different `plot_type`. Then pivot these summaries into a 
>    a data set with a column for `hindfoot_length` and `weight`. 
> 
>   *Hint*: This sounds like you want to pivot the data to be a wider format! 


```{r, answer=TRUE, purl=FALSE}
combined_long %>%
   group_by(year, measurement, plot_type) %>%
   ## group by three variables! 
   summarize(mean_value = mean(value, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
   ## summarize the mean of each measurement at each plot type, each year 
   pivot_wider(names_from = measurement, values_from = mean_value)
   ## pivot the dataframe into a wider format, using the measurements as a pivot
   ## and filling each column with the mean_value for that measurement/plot type/year
```

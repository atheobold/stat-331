#### Step 1  

<!-- Move to next week! -->

Aubrey hopes that his songs will be percieved as authentically hiphop. He hopes
his lyrics will be recognizeable to those who describe themselves as hiphop
fans, but less recognizeable to those who do not consider themselves fans. 
Suggest some words or phrases that Aubrey should try to use, and some words he
should avoid. 

*Hint: Do not simply find the most popular words in each category.  Think about words that are very different between hiphop fans and nonfans.*

```{r}

fans <- hiphop %>% 
  ## At least the top third of genres
  filter(hiphop >= 7) %>%
  group_by(word) %>% 
  summarize(avg_fam = mean(familiarity))

not_fans <- hiphop %>% 
  ## Hiphop in the lowest third of genres
  filter(hiphop < 4) %>%
  group_by(word) %>% 
  summarize(avg_fam = mean(familiarity))


new <- full_join(fans, not_fans, by = "word") %>%
  mutate(
    diff = avg_fam.x - avg_fam.y
  ) 

new %>% top_n(5, diff)
new %>% top_n(5, desc(diff))

```

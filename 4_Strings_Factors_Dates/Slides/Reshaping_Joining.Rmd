# Setup

Find your R Markdown file in which you explored the `cereals` data.

(This was probably called `Practice.Rmd`.)

# Reshaping

* Note that the `cereals` dataset has separate columns for each nutritional item (`calories`, `sugar`, etc.)

* What if we want to make a plot comparing some of these measures?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(cereals, aes(x = ...????))

```

# Pivoting longer

What if we want to make boxplots comparing the different bill dimensions of penguins?


```{r, error = TRUE}
ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = Bill.Dimension, y = Size, fill = species)) +
  geom_boxplot()

```

# Pivoting longer

```{r}

penguins %>%
  pivot_longer(bill_length_mm:bill_depth_mm, 
               names_to = "Bill.Dimension", 
               values_to = "Size")

# Alert:
## `pivot_longer()` is a new function name!
## It used to be called `gather()`
## `gather()` will still work, but I suggest you run `install.packages("tidyr")`

# Try it!

Create a new dataset called `cereals_3`, that has three columns:
* The name of the cereal
* A column called "Nutrient" with values `protein`, `fat`, or `fiber`.
* A column called "Amount" with the corresponding amount of the nutrient.

# Pivoting wider

What about the reverse reshaping?

```{r, error = TRUE}
penguins %>%
  select(species, body_mass_g) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = species, 
              values_from = body_mass_g)

```

---
# Pivoting wider

Need row IDs to pivot wide!

```{r, echo = FALSE}
penguins %>%
  rowid_to_column() 
```

# Tip 3:
## Separate your task into bite-size steps
### ... and write them down!
### (This is called *decomposition*.)

---
# Pivoting wider

```{r}
penguins %>%
  rowid_to_column() %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = species, 
              values_from = body_mass_g,
              id_cols = rowid)

```

# Try it!

Cereals in this dataset are placed on shelf 1, 2, or 3.  We would like to know if these cereal placements correspond to different nutritional values.

Create a new dataset called `cereals_4`, that has four columns:
* The name of the manufacturer
* The mean amount of sugar in cereals on shelf 1.
* The mean amount of sugar in cereals on shelf 2.
* The mean amount of sugar in cereals on shelf 3.

*Hint: You will need to `group_by` and `summarize` first!`

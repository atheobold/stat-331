# Strings

A **string** is a bunch of **characters**.

Don't confuse a **string** (many characters, one object) with a 
**character vector** (vector of strings)


```{r}
my_string <- "Hi, my name is Bond!"

my_vector <- c("Hi", "my", "name", "is", "Bond")

my_string

my_vector
```

---

# Strings

Common tasks:

* Find which strings contain a particular pattern

* Remove or replace a pattern

* Edit a string (for example, make it lowercase)


The packages `stringr` is very useful for strings!  
  *`stringr` loads with the `tidyverse`

---

# Find patterns

```{r, eval = FALSE}
my_vector <- c("Hello,", "my name is", "Bond", "James Bond")

str_detect(my_vector, "Bond")
str_locate(my_vector, "Bond")
str_match(my_vector, "Bond")
str_extract(my_vector, "Bond")
str_subset(my_vector, "Bond")

```

# Exercise: What's the difference?

For each of these functions, give:

a) The **object structure** of the output.

b) The **data type** of the output.

c) A brief explanation of what they do.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
str_detect(my_vector, "Bond")
str_locate(my_vector, "Bond")
str_extract(my_vector, "Bond")
str_subset(my_vector, "Bond")
str_match(my_vector, "Bond")
```

---
# Answers

```{r}
my_vector <- c("Hello,", "my name is", "Bond", "James Bond")
str_detect(my_vector, "Bond")

```

--

Returns a **logical vector** indicating if the pattern was found in that element of the original vector.

---

# Answers

```{r}
my_vector <- c("Hello,", "my name is", "Bond", "James Bond")
str_match(my_vector, "Bond")

```

--

Returns a **character matrix** with either `NA` or the pattern, depending on if the pattern was found.

---

```{r}
my_vector <- c("Hello,", "my name is", "Bond", "James Bond")
str_extract(my_vector, "Bond")

```

---
# Answers

```{r}
my_vector <- c("Hello,", "my name is", "Bond", "James Bond")
str_locate(my_vector, "Bond")

```

--

Returns a **data frame** with two **numeric variables** giving either `NA` or the start and end position of the pattern.

```{r}
my_vector <- c("Hello,", "my name is", "Bond", "James Bond")
str_subset(my_vector, "Bond")

```

---

# Replace/Remove patterns


```{r}
my_vector <- c("Hello,", "my name is", "Bond", "James Bond")
str_remove(my_vector, "Bond")
str_replace(my_vector, "Bond", replacement = "Franco")
```

--

*Ask yourself:*  What is the output?

---

# Make edits

```{r}
my_string <- "Hello, my name is Bond, James Bond."

str_to_lower(my_string)
str_to_upper(my_string)
```

---
# Stringr

Of course, we will not practice every single function in the `stringr` package.

Refer to the `stringr` cheatsheet:  https://stringr.tidyverse.org/

Use it to answer the following:


* What is the difference between `length()` and `str_length()`?

* What is the difference between `str_replace()` and `str_replace_all()`?

* What is the difference between `str_trim()` and `str_trunc()`?

* What is the difference between `str_sub()` and `str_subset()`?

* What does the `collapse` argument do in `str_c()`?

# Your Turn

Using your *colleges_clean* dataset, answer these questions:

1. How exactly does Cal Poly's name appear in this dataset?

2. How many colleges have the word "University" in their name?

3. Which college has the *longest* name?  The *shortest* name?

---

# Hints

*Hint 1:* The code below will work, but may not be quite correct.  Why?
    
```{r, eval = FALSE}
str_count(colleges_clean$INSTNM, "University")
```

<!-- This double counts two institutions, since they have University in their name -->
<!-- twice! -->

*Hint 2:*  Remember that the `str_*` functions need the first argument to be a
**vector of strings**, not a **dataset**.  You might want to use them *inside*
functions like `filter` or `mutate`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
colleges_clean %>%
  mutate(
    is_CA = str_detect(INSTNM, "California")
  )
```


```{r, include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
colleges_clean$INSTNM %>%
  str_subset("Polytechnic")
```


```{r, include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
colleges_clean %>%
  mutate(
    is_univ = str_detect(INSTNM, "University")
  ) %>%
  count(is_univ)
```


```{r, include = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
colleges_clean %>%
  mutate(
    name_len = str_length(INSTNM)
  ) %>% 
  slice_min(name_len) 
```

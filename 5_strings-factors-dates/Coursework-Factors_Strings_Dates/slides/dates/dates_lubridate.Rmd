# Dates

.pull-left[
Common tasks:

* Convert a date-like variable ("January 14, 1989") to a special DateTime Object.

* Find the weekday, month, year, etc from a DateTime object

* Convert between timezones
]

--

.pull-right[
The package `lubridate` is AMAZING for this. 
  * `lubridate` does not **load** with the `tidyverse` but it does **install**
  with it.

.larger[`datetime` Objects]

There are actually three data types (classes) in R for dates and datetimes.

- **Date** (duh)
- **POSIXlt** (???)
- and **POSIXct** (???)

---

.large[History of `POSIXlt` and `POSIXct`]

.pull-left[

- `POSIXct` -- stores date/time values as the number of seconds since
January 1, 1970 ("Unix Epoch")

- `POSIXlt` -- stores date/time values as a list with elements for second,
minute, hour, day, month, and year, among others. 
]

.pull-right[
In the "old days", to make a Date or Datetime object, you'd have to get the
format *just right*.

```{r}
as.Date("1989-01-14") %>% str()
as_datetime("1989-01-14") %>% str()
```
]

---

.larger[Today: `lubridate`]

.pull-left[
```{r}
make_date(year = 1989, month = 01, day = 14)
mdy("January 14, 1989")
dmy("14-Jan-1989", tz = "America/Denver")
```

]

--

.pull-right[
```{r}
parse_datetime("1/14/1989", format = "mdy")

parse_datetime("1/14/1989", 
               format = "%m/%d/%Y")

```
]

# Common mistake

What's wrong here?

```{r}
as_datetime(2021-04-25)
```

--

```{r}
my_date <- 2021-04-25
my_date
```

---

.larger[Components of Dates]

```{r}
bday <- ymd_hms("1989-01-14 12:12:12")
```

.pull-left[
```{r}
year(bday)
month(bday)
day(bday)
```

]

.pull-right[
```{r}
wday(bday)

wday(bday, label = TRUE)
```

]

.larger[When is my ______ birthday?]

.pull-left[
.large[next]

```{r}

  wday(label = TRUE)
```
]

.pull-right[

# lubridate

Reference the `lubridate` cheatsheet: https://evoldyn.gitlab.io/evomics-2018/ref-sheets/R_lubridate.pdf

Use it, and your own experiments, to answer the following:

*Hint:* Consider data types and object structures!

1. What is the difference between `year()` and `years()`?

<!-- year() -- extracts the year of a datetime object -->
<!-- years() -- creates a period object based on number of years  -->

2. What `tz` would you use for San Luis Obispo? 

<!-- tz = "America/Los_Angeles" -->

3. What is the difference between `%within%` and `%--%`?

<!-- %within% checks if a date is included in an interval -->
<!-- %--% creates an interval with a start and end time  -->
 
4. What happens if you use the `parse_datetime()` function,
but you do not provide a `day` argument?

<!-- Assigns the first day of that month! -->

---

.larger[Your Turn!]

Answer the following using code (even if you know the answer already).

First, use the `make_date()` function to save your birthday as a
Datetime object in R.  

1. What day of the week does/did your birthday fall on in 2021?

2. On what day of the week should you plan your 50th birthday party?

3. Find the date that is exactly 9 months before the day you were born.  If it falls on a holiday, think about the implications.

A More In-depth Exploration of Functionals -- [*Advanced R*](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/functionals.html)

`r emo::ji("check")` **Check-in: Functional Programming**

**Question 1:**

Suppose we would like to find the median of the measurement variables 
(`bill_length_mm`, `bill_depth_mm`, `flipper_length_mm`, `body_mass_g`) from the
`penguins` dataset (from the **palmerpenguins** package). Which of the following
will produce a **vector** of the median of every measurement variable?

*Select all that apply!*

_(a)_
```{r, include = FALSE}
# Returns a list
penguins %>% 
  select(bill_length_mm:body_mass_g) %>% 
  map(median, na.rm = TRUE)
```

_(b)_
```{r, include = FALSE}
# Correct!
penguins %>% 
  select(bill_length_mm:body_mass_g) %>% 
  map_dbl(median, na.rm = TRUE)
```

_(c)_
```{r, include = FALSE}
# Correct!
penguins %>% 
  select(bill_length_mm:body_mass_g) %>% 
  sapply(., median, na.rm = TRUE)
```

_(d)_
```{r, include = FALSE}
# Returns a list
penguins %>% 
  select(bill_length_mm:body_mass_g) %>% 
  lapply(., function(x) median(x, na.rm = TRUE))
```

***

Recall that in the last unit, we discussed the challenge of standardizing many
columns in a data frame.  For example, we wanted to standardize all the numeric 
variables in the `penguins` dataset.

Here is the function we wrote for that:

```{r}
standardize <- function(data) {
  deviations <- data - mean(data, na.rm = TRUE)
  newdata <- deviations / sd(data, na.rm = TRUE)
  return(newdata)
}
```

**Question 2:** Why does the following not work?

```{r}
penguins %>%
  mutate(
    body_mass_g = map_dbl(body_mass_g, standardize)
  )
```

<!-- The `map_dbl()` function expects a single output from a list or atomic vector. -->
<!-- If you use `safely(standardize)` you should get the following error:  -->

<!-- ``` -->
<!-- Error: Result 1 must be a single double, not a list of length 2 -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- This means that `map_dbl()` expects that the result should have length 1!  -->


**Question 3:** 

Use appropriate `map` functions, along with `scale()`, to create
a standardized version of the measurement variables from the `penguins` dataset
(`bill_length_mm`, `bill_depth_mm`, `flipper_length_mm`, `body_mass_g`).
Do this **without** copy-pasting lines and changing `bill_length_mm` to
`bill_depth_mm`, etc.

I recommend looking into `map_df()` or `map_at()`! 

```{r, include = FALSE}

penguins %>%
  map_at(vars(bill_length_mm:body_mass_g), 
         standardize)

penguins %>% 
  select(bill_length_mm:body_mass_g) %>% 
  map_df(., standardize)

```
